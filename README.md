# HeartProject

The app, which tells you where your donation is needed around you!

## The idea

Europe will have to take care of more refugees than ever before in the next few years. People from many different countries are desperate for help and do not have the bare minimum to survive.
Many organisations are helping independently of each other by collecting all sorts of donations.

* helphelp2 connects these organisations with people who would like to help, but do not know how.
* helphelp2 answers the question “What donations are currently needed in my area and where can I take them?”

When you start the app, it will show you places nearby where you can take your donations. Anyone who wants to help can start the app while shopping and buy what's needed to take to people in need in the area.
Organisations can update their lists of needed products in real-time. The app also shows the address and business hours of the aid organisations.

The app is free of charge for organisations and anyone who would like to help.
